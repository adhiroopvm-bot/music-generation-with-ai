# music-generation-with-ai
Collect MIDI music data to train your AI model (classical, jazz etc.). ● Preprocess the data into note sequences suitable for training (e.g., using `music21`). ● Build a deep learning model using RNNs (like LSTM) or GANs to learn music patterns. ● Train the model on the dataset to generate new music sequences.
